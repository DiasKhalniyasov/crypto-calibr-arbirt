Crypto-Options Volatility Surface Calibration and Arbitrage

Under the supervision of Roland Grinis, PhD, МФТИ, GrinisRIT

The aim of the project is to understand the dynamics of the volatility surface for crypto-options. Options trading for BTC and ETH on centralised exchanges has been around already for some time. But only now, it starts to draw considerable attention and experiences noticeable growth, mainly driven by strong interest from institutional investors and traders in the crypto space. The practical side of the project will start first with gathering volatility surface quotes data from the Deribit exchange, which is by far the largest options trading exchange. With that data collected, we will be able to calibrate various models form the course on Computation Finance, getting a good deal of hands-on experience with the numerical methods involved in the calibrarion and risk calculations. And finally we will backtest some of the classical options trading strategies and look up for potential arbitrage opportunities in this market.
